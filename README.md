# CountriesDetails
Fetch deatils about the countries of the world, and displays them in a list.
Uses MVVM with no 3rd party libraries.

Data resides in the following address: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all

The objective is to show short info about every country, and upon click, show additional data about that country.

Furthermore, I implemented a "last country" save mechanism, to display the last clicked country, in case of no internet connection.
